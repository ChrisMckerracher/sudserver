Coming from 'Big Tech' as a software developer, I wanted to work somewhere where I could have a bigger impact individually. My first attempt was creating a health-tech startup, which while ultimately failed, made me realize that I enjoy organizing people around a product-defined mission statement. Being a software developer, I have a generally strong technical background, which I keep up to date with various personal projects(see github).

Aside from my experiences leading a product in my startup, I've had experiences with project management through my award-winning consultancy on anti-bullying legislation while I was in highschool. I also co-ran a World of Warcraft guild, where under my single season of tenure, managed to improve the guild's US-regional rankings by 50%.
